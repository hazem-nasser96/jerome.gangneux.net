                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>As you can imagine, I am not only developing for VR but also testing a lot of things.<br />
From hardware to software, I try my best to access many experimentation.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-playstation-vr">About the PlayStation VR</h2>

<p>A few day ago, a friend of mine show me the PlayStation VR, and it is quite good.<br />
The headset is very classic and the tracking — including PlayStation Move — was not easy to calibrate.
But the main point in this headset is that we don't see the pixel grid, they use special optic and it gives a blurry sensation but it is not as bad as seeing the pixel of the screen.<br />
It is quite a good trick while waiting for better screen (and they are coming).</p>

<h2 id="about-vtime%3A-a-vr-social-network">About vTime: a VR Social Network</h2>

<p>On the software side I tested <a href="https://vtime.net/">vTime</a> the "VR social network".<br />
The onboarding was very painful, requiring you to hop on and off from VR multiple times, one time was — sigh — to confirm your email address, who does that anyway?<br />
Otherwise, the avatar setup experience was quite ok, it is like in The Sims.<br />
After it continues to get frustrating, you must connect with "friends" but as you can imagine I don't have many friends using VR yet. So I randomly connected with people and I joined a conversation, it was very awkward to talk with these persons.<br />
But I continued, to get the full experience, and there is a major difference between VR mode and "classic old chat" mode: it is the fact that you can not be passive because your "VR" body is here and people can look at you (as it is done in vTime).<br />
It was not a pleasant experience for a person like me.</p>

<h2 id="about-360-videos-and-ads">About 360 videos and Ads</h2>

<p>I was watching a VR video, I can't remember which one but whatever.<br />
It was on Youtube VR, and as usual this was kind of cool, very immersive and so on.<br />
But here, in the middle of the video, I found myself blocked in a giant cube with an unrelated advertising video playing on the four walls. It was loud and I felt trapped.
I was not able to look somewhere else (as you could do in real life) of course I could close my eyes but the sound would continue.
That was a horrible experience, I stopped Youtube (the only action I found at that time)</p>

<h1 id="progress">Progress</h1>

        The keyboard is not here to type in the Google search field<br>
        (optical trick on this image)

</div>

<p>The main subject of this session was to create a classic Android App that would let me test the bridge I created between Android and OpenGL/Unity without having to implement it in Unity every time.</p>

<p>Also, I experimented with a VR keyboard, it is only to anticipate new problematic due to keyboard usage.
I'm hopping that google will soon release their official VR keyboard for Unity.</p>

<p>I worked on the keyboard event from views coming from Android, as usual it is not that simple, you have to intercept and forwards each event. This was not a success.<br />
I guess I should wait a little for the official Google VR keyboard to pop :)</p>

        Last version of my experimentations with an external Keyboard<br>
        Thank you Kelly for the Horse :)

<p>As usual, I've got a few emails asking me to get the WebView public or any kind of help.
Unfortunately I am not an expert, and most of the time I can not help much.<br />
For the rest of it, all the details are on this blog.</p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next steps</h1>

<p>I may take a break for one or two weeks on these reports as I'm waiting for the Google keyboard, so I can get more visual progress, and it will be more interesting for you.
Don't worry I will continue to work — and learn — on VR.</p>

<h1 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship</h1>

<p>I'm looking for any kind of sponsorship, let it be hardware loan or money.<br />
Because as an individual, it can be quite expensive to get some hardware to experiment things.</p>
