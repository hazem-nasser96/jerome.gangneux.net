                <p>This is my personal testimony against overnight success and all those marketing stories that people try to sell — most of the time literally with ebooks or other products —.</p>

<p>In 2019, I sold Thread Reader App, and that is some success in my point of view.</p>

<p>I started to develop the projet as a side project, or to be more correct as a support for my videos tutorials, which was the side project. Then it went viral, and I had the chance to make it work.</p>

<p>For some, it looks like an overnight success, but it was not.
Before having that lucky shoot, I made, or participated in, plenty of projects.</p>

<h3 id="most-of-it-failed.">Most of it failed.</h3>

<p>This list is here to show you that it needed <strong>numerous</strong> tries.<br />
Then you can understand that, before getting somewhere, you may have to try very hard.</p>

<p>This list only contain projects that I wanted to make money with.<br />
Note, when I say "made 0€" it really means, cost me a bunch of money + my own time.</p>

</ul>

<p>And then after I started a bunch of new <strike>failures</strike> projects, namely: snooze.me, Glitch App, toFeed, Artillery Royale (the later cost me 10k€ and I got nothing from it).</p>

<p>Ten years, about 33 projects, only one lucky shoot…</p>

<p>There is no overnight success.</p>
