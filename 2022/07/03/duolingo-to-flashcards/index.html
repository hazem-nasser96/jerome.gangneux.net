<h2 id="long-intro">Long Intro</h2>

<p>You may — or may not — know me, but let me tell you one of my passion in life: connect everything together.</p>

<p>When I was young — let's say 15 — I tried to connect a landline phone to my computer sound card, learning a lesson here: landline in France carry a bit of electricity and my computer did not like it. I had to play without sound for a while.</p>

<p>I also have a project in the work about connecting plants to synthesizers, so we could hear them grow — but I have yet to find more time to work on it.</p>

<p>And of course, a part of my job is to connect programs (APIs) together to build products and services.</p>

<p>Anyway, today I'm going to talk about a more down to earth usage, hacky one, but a need I had.</p>

<p>I'm trying to learn a new language (Spanish) mostly for fun and brain practice. And for that, I'm using the app Duolingo. It's good (for now) but it does not have a feature I love: flashcards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A flashcard is a card bearing information on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an answer on the other. Flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical dates, formulas or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards can be virtual (part of a flashcard software), or physical. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard" title="❤️ wikipedia">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other side, it exists free flashcard apps like: Ankiapp that allows user to make their own flashcard set, and even in that case, import CSV into it.</p>

<p>Say no more, let's connect those together.</p>

<h2 id="connect-everything">Connect Everything</h2>

<p>First, I need an API point on the Duolingo part, but unfortunately, it does not exist… The internet being a magic place full of ressources, I found someone working on an unofficial API. Thank you, <a href="#">@KartikTalwar</a>, for <a href="#">github.com/KartikTalwar/Duolingo</a>.</p>

<p>I took me sometime to explore the API (without doc) and found some endpoints that would do the job.</p>

<p>The next step is the easy one, take my favorite scripting language PHP and build a CSV file from this info. After a bit of test, it works as expected, I cleaned up the whole projet and decided to put it online, so you could use it too.</p>

<p>Find it here <a href="https://github.com/jrmgx/duo-vocabulary">github.com/jrmgx/duo-vocabulary</a> you have all the information to use it on the repository. It's easy with docker, you don't have to install anything <code>docker run jrmgx/duo-vocabulary [parameters] &gt; output.csv</code></p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>It has some specific hardcoded rules to remove feminine and plural words, but those rules only work for Spanish (the language I'm learning right now).</li>
<li>Duolingo does not provide an official API, for that reason, it may stop working at anytime (without any way to fix it).</li>
<li>From what I understood, calls to <code>dictionary/hints</code> endpoint are limited in payload size, it may have to be split at some point, but for now, with my current usage it works like that.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p>I made a <a href="https://telegram.me/FlashCartesBot?start=perso">telegram bot</a> that can handle those CSV to be used as a flashcard bot</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
