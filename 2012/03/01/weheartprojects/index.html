<p>Most Week-end do(s) ended up with some recurring people showing up, so “We Heart Projects” was a collective born from the need to formalize that aspect.</p>

<p>We were seeing each other every month and made new projects, most of them stayed at the idea stage, 
but we also did a bunch of casual games.</p>

<h2 id="my-role">My role</h2>

<p>I was planing the meetings, and as a developer I participated in most of the technical part of each projects</p>

<p><em>The collective is closed</em></p>

<p>The next useless thus indispensable game. A new way to twiddling your thumbs.</p>

<p>Scroll as far as you can and challenge your friends!</p>

<p>“We were unable to get the game to end. It appears to keep counting for an unlimited time.” The App Store team.</p>

<p>I think this will show you the gameplay</p>

<p>With Get Ready Go, you can test your reflexes and see who’s the fastest between you and your friends.</p>

<p>It can be either a simple drinking game, or an easy way to decide who’s turn it is to wash the dishes.</p>

<h2 id="color-stroop">Color Stroop</h2>

<p>Do you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect">Stroop effect</a>?</p>

<p>It’s the interference produced by a non-relevant information when performing a cognitive task.</p>

<p>This game is all about the Stroop effect!
You need to pick the name matching the right color. Easy?</p>

<h2 id="jump-the-rope">Jump the rope</h2>

<p>A casual game to play solo or with a friend on the same phone.<br />
Just jump the rope and see how long you can go, the speed will increase over time and records are hard to get!</p>

<h2 id="the-kids-project">The kids project</h2>

<p>With the collective we were very interested in game 
and also we wanted to make game for kids as a way to learn new things while playing.</p>

<p>We started to think about a series of games, helped by a teacher.<br />
Unfortunately we did not go far on this series as it was close to the end of the collective, but still there are two examples of what we made:</p>

<h3 id="find-the-animals">FIND THE ANIMALS</h3>

<p>The first one is a memory game, which get through the app store,
but is now abandoned as our priorities moved on.</p>
