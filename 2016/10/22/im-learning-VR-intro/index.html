                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A few month ago I felt that something was going on.
When I started to work in 2007 we needed web developers.
Then around 2012 the mobile revolution arrived, luckily I started learning mobile development thanks to a side project (the My Laboratory game).
I had the opportunity to work with Objective-C and iOS.
In 2012, I decided to become a mobile developer.</p>

<p>So here I go, I’m jumping in the unknown again!
I will be even more difficult this time because I’m talking about VR.</p>

<p>And VR for me is constituted of two skill I don’t have (yet):</p>

<ul>
<li>Math (move objects in space, transformation, rotation, matrices)</li>
<li>Design (create nice looking objects, 3D interfaces)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

<p>II had a vision when Mark Zuckerberg did the Oculus conference of 2016,
I understood VR.
I mean, more than only the entertainment aspect of it.
I understood that it is a second world, a world of freedom, material freedom, where everything is possible.</p>

<p>In this spirit, I want to create a development environment in VR for VR.
The goal is to allow people to develop (and improve) the environment in which they live / work on.
At the end they should be able to upgrade it without needing to go out of it, and so iterate very fast, experiment more.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2>

<p>So yeah, I know nothing about VR.
I don’t know any 3D software, nor 3D engine.</p>

<p>My choice is Daydream from Google for the VR platform,
because it is cheap (on the hardware side as well as the software).</p>

<p>I will learn Blender (for 3D modeling) and Unity (for the 3D engine).</p>

<p>I will try to go step by step, and report my finding here.</p>

<p>The first step will be to get Daydream working,
to create a 3D model of a keyboard and put it in the VR world and bind a visual feedback (from the real keyboard).
I already have a Bluetooth keyboard, so I will connect it to the headset,
the Daydream controller will be the mouse.</p>

<p>I will give you more detail on my next report,
we will see where this is going.</p>
