        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>It was about time, I decided to update my stack and use docker on my servers.</p>

<p>For the ones that follows me I usually prefer to set up a bare metal server with Debian Apache PHP and MySQL installed on it.<br />
My excuses — if I even need some — were a mix between performances and simplicity.</p>

<p>But today I'm experimenting with multiple small projects, and they all are on the same server.
It's still a bare metal server, and I'm not — yet — changing this for a cloud provider, we can talk about this in another blog post.</p>

<p>Multiple projects with a single server can lead to some incompatible dependencies,
in my specific scenario I need some PHP extension that is obsolete and works only with older PHP version, but I don't want to carry this limitation to all my projects.</p>

<p>Why Apache and not Nginx? <a href="https://youtu.be/-rmf5EqJVDw?t=16">No reason &copy;</a>.</p>

<p>Let's see how I built my LAMP stack with Docker (should we say DAMP?)</p>

<h1 id="php">PHP</h1>

<p>I used the <code>php:7.4-fpm</code> base image and added some extensions, those vary depending on the current project.</p>

<p>I added composer because it's always handy to have it there, plus, and this may be up for discussion, I added NodeJS + PM2 in this image too.</p>

<p>Node is often needed for the front end (compiling asset and such) and I did not want the complexity of another image (but I'm open for comment/PR on this one)
as well as <a href="pm2.keymetrics.io/">PM2</a> that I use for my background scripts. 
For example like this: <code>pm2 start --name php_messenger_consume php -- bin/console -n messenger:consume async --limit=10 --memory-limit=128M --time-limit=3600</code></p>

<p>It's very handy to have it on the same image as PHP, and does not look even possible otherwise (let me know in the comments).</p>

<p><code class="filepath">file:///docker/php/Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">

</code></pre>

<h1 id="apache">Apache</h1>

<p>This on is a bit more tricky.</p>

<p>First on my production server I won't use it, the server will have a real Apache with vhosts configured properly forwarding to each different projects.
Those final vhosts will look similar to the one below that I use in the development image.</p>

<p>So for the dev env (hence the <code>docker-compose-dev.yml</code> coming up below) it will have Apache.</p>

<p>The goal is to redirect the query that hit the server to PHP FPM.</p>

<p>For this, I first tried to use the base image <code>httpd:2.4</code> it seemed logic to me but for some reason I never succeeded to make it work, (have you? PR welcome).
I ended up using a debian base <code>debian:buster-slim</code> and installed Apache on my own (probably not optimal, but we are on a dev environment).</p>

<p>It has <em>mod proxy fast CGI</em> and <em>mod rewrite</em> activated as we will use it in our config.</p>

<p><code class="filepath">file:///docker/apache/Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">
FROM debian:buster-slim

RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    apache2 \
    &amp;&amp; a2enmod proxy_fcgi \
    &amp;&amp; a2enmod rewrite

CMD /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND

</code></pre>

<h1 id="mysql">MySQL</h1>

<p>I'm using the base image <code>mysql</code> with some options like <code>MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD</code> and <code>cap_add: SYS_NICE</code>. 
The later prevent the error message "mbind: Operation not permitted" as seen on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55706057/696517">stackoverflow.com</a></p>

<h1 id="connecting-everything-together">Connecting everything together</h1>

<p>The idea now it to put everything together:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apache will be exposed to some port and redirect requests to PHP-FPM.</li>
<li>PHP will be able to connect to the database.</li>
<li>And also we can use PHP as a command line on our server to execute PHP commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>I added comments on the file directly, so you have the context.</p>

<p><small>Note: the name of the project is "bookmark" in this example</small></p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>

<p><code class="filepath">file:///docker-compose.yml</code></p>

<p>Now the version for local dev</p>

<p>As you probably now, docker-compose config files cascade (like CSS), and we can supersede options
Again I added comment strait in the file for context.</p>

<h2 id="glue-in-between">Glue in between</h2>

<p>Be it in production or development, having apache on the server or in a docker image,
you know have to redirect web request to PHP FPM</p>

<p>This is done with an Apache config file (here called <code>vhosts.conf</code> for historical reasons)</p>

<p>This config file is similar between a production environment and a dev environment,
main differences will be explained in inline comments</p>

<p>Note: the base version here is the dev environment.</p>

Details: for a given movie,</p>

<p>1/ Getting the average color of each frame, then putting pixel after pixel on the video<br />
2/ Generating a music track from each color component (R/G/B) for the kick, piano, bass<br />
3/ Merge all in the video at 200fps</p>

Note: the final video does not suffer from any compression artifacts.</p>

<p>I my opinion, one of the best parts is around 4:30 
where something very bright happen in the movie and is well reflected in the soundtrack</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note: This project has been acquired in 2020, I'm no longer the owner of Glitch Clip App</strong></p>

<p>Glitch Clip is an App for iPad that allows you to create generative videos thanks to some artsy visual effects (kaleidoscope, mosaic, twist and 20+ more) or to make creative VJing shows with live music.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>1/ Select short video clips and start remixing it. Add effects (kaleidoscope, mosaic, twist and more) and glitch things!<br />
2/ Switch from one clip to another really fast, it's made for live performances. You can also import your own clips.<br />
3/ Explore generative art, fine tune your effect stack to make artsy videos you can then share with your friends!<br />
4/ Connect a keyboard or a MIDI controller to the app. From here everything is possible: play live from your controller or synchronize your DAW.</p>

<p>Glitch Clip is made for video DJing (VJing) but you can simply use it to have fun in your own way!
And of course you can also record and export your video.</p>

        <link href="/2018/05/01/thread-reader-tools"/>
        <updated>2018-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>/2018/05/01/thread-reader-tools</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note: This project has been acquired in 2018, I'm no longer the owner of ThreadReaderApp</strong></p>

<p><em>This is a technical article about Thread Reader,
for more context <a href="/posts/category/threadreader">see the whole series here</a></em></p>

<h1 id="hardware-and-server-stack">Hardware and Server Stack</h1>

<p>I have my own server from <a href="https://kimsufi.com">kimsufi.com</a> (Canada based).
It is an Intel i5 at 2.8GHz with 16GB RAM and 2TB of hard drive, Network is 100Mbps.</p>

<p>I use a very basic setup, with Apache2, PHP and MySQL under Ubuntu.
It has memcached for some caching layer, even if most of the content is cached on the hard drive.</p>

<p>I use Sphinx search to power the "related thread" feature as well as the search feature (obviously).</p>

<p>So, yes it is PHP + basic CSS (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>) + basic javascript (<a href="http://jquery.com/">jquery</a>).</p>

<h3 id="notable">Notable</h3>

<ul>
<li>I'm using the <a href="https://silex.symfony.com/">Silex</a> PHP micro framework and some Symfony components</li>
<li>PHP sessions are in memcached</li>
<li>Apache is configured to cache everything very violently</li>
<li>All this is backed by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> caching</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="server-metrics-as-may-2018">Server Metrics as May 2018</h3>

<ul>
<li>Average load is close to 0.3 and can go close to 1 when 800+ visits/minutes</li>
<li>The database is &lt; 2Gb and the whole hard drive caching + code is about 25Gb</li>
<li>RAM is half used on a normal day, no swapping</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h1>

<p>To monitor the server I mostly use cron jobs that check for specific signals:</p>

<ul>
<li>I check the size of the job queue</li>
<li>I check that the bot has said something in the last hour</li>
</ul>

<p>If something is wrong I get an email, I also have a basic alert mechanism from Kimsufi when the server is down.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I have a term open on my server with a <code>tail -f</code> on logs (I use SSH + <a href="https://mosh.org/">mosh</a>).</p>

<p>Logs include many things: payments hooks, Apache errors, bot mentions and replies, job outputs and more.<br />
These logs are also accessible on the web via an admin page I have access to.</p>

<h2 id="in-case-of-emergency">In case of emergency</h2>

<p>If something goes wrong about performance I use:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>top</code> to check CPU and RAM usage</li>
<li><code>iotop</code> to check disk usage</li>
<li><code>iftop</code> to check network usage</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the time it is not a performance issue but more a bug that cause some edge case.</p>

<p>For example last one was some thread that was unrolled and posted on Twitter,
got something like 300 RT and then the author deleted the thread. 
So any visitor would arrive at the thread page but nothing was found on the database 
and so the bot tried to unroll it but it was not on Twitter any more (times 1000 visits). Made a mess. Fixed now.</p>

<h2 id="web-admin-interface">Web Admin interface</h2>

<p>I made an admin interface with the minimum to do some monitoring about the service (not the server).</p>

<ul>
<li>I can get the last unrolls and trending pages.</li>
<li>I can check user details, and upgrade to Premium</li>
<li>I can do some action on threads like force refresh for example.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="scripts-and-crons">Scripts and Crons</h1>

<p>I have plenty of scripts and Crons that runs on the server:</p>

<pre><code>21 3 * * * /threadreader/cron/CheckUser.php &gt; /logs/cron.log
45 4 * * * /threadreader/cron/CheckThread.php &gt; /logs/cron.log
0 8 * * * /threadreader/cron/UsageReporting.php &gt; /logs/cron.log
0 8 * * * /threadreader/cron/MoneyReporting.php &gt; /logs/cron.log
0 8 2 * * /threadreader/cron/MoneyReporting.php --period=month &gt; /logs/cron.log
17 */3 * * * /threadreader/cron/StaticTrending.php &gt; /logs/cron.log
10 * * * * /threadreader/cron/Health.php &gt; /logs/cron.log
</code></pre>

<p>I have two more Cron: database backup and software updates running every day.</p>

<p>Then I have all these scripts that loops all the time with sometime a bit of waiting <code>sleep</code>.
These are started in a <code>screen</code> that is configured to auto start if the server reboots (never happened)</p>

<ul>
<li>Check for bot mentions</li>
<li>Update existing threads</li>
<li>Check for deleted threads</li>
<li>Check for deleted users</li>
<li>Run jobs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="queue-and-job-mechanism">Queue and job mechanism</h2>

<p>Thread Reader needs a queuing mechanism for two reasons:<br />
long processing jobs (like thread archiving) and relative scheduled actions (DM/emails alerts)</p>

<p>This one is so low tech that I'm almost ashamed to talk about but...</p>

<p>It is a MySQL table where I enqueue a command name with its arguments, 
I add the time when I want it to be executed and a return code to check later.<br />
Then a script pulls entries one by one and execute them.</p>

<h1 id="backup-and-security">Backup and security</h1>

<ul>
<li>SSH via public key and no root</li>
<li>Every port closed (via <code>ufw</code>) except ssh and http/s</li>
<li>Apache and PHP are configured with paranoia in mind</li>
</ul>

<p>Thread Reader is quite a special case about data as it does not have so much content, nor original content.<br />
Still. A full dump of the database is saved every day (cron script), 
encrypted and sync to <a href="https://dropbox.com">dropbox.com</a> (true)<br />
No other data are saved as it is only caching.</p>

<h1 id="external-services-and-tools">External Services and Tools</h1>

<p>For thread reader I only use a few external services:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">Mail Gun</a> to send emails: I chose them because the registration was the most straight forward and the pricing competitive.</li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> to allow people to pay by Credit Card: They are the best for developers for sure.</li>
<li>Paypal so people can pay without giving any bank info: It is widely used even if it is a pain for developers.</li>
<li>Google Analytics and Google AdSense for analytics and ads.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="support-and-twitter-ecosystem">Support and Twitter ecosystem</h2>

<p>I use services to keep in touch with my users on Twitter:<br />
I did use <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> 
but I changed to (the ugly) <a href="https://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> recently 
as they allow to see your DM inbox separately of the outbox.
This is very important because I use the same account for the support and the bot (it sends thousands of DM by day).</p>

<p>Most of the support is done by Twitter and email (inbox by Gmail setup with custom domain).</p>

<h2 id="development-software-and-services">Development Software and Services</h2>

<p>I have a private <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> repository for the code, 
I use the issue tracking and the project view to keep my TODOs.
I use github for deployment too, <code>master</code> is clean and get pulled on production every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>For big updates that need a database change I jump on the server and do the necessary manually. 
This is very rare as the service is quite well-structured now.</p>

<p>To connect to my database I use <a href="https://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> via SSH, 
it has some custom options to plays nicely with the database (like not requesting full blobs etc).</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>As you can see nothing fancy, it is good old technology.<br />
Boring working stuff.</p>

<p>I made a bunch of shell scripts to interact with Twitter API, but in general I am not in favor of making my own tools.</p>

<p>What I like in this setup is the performance: I get to handle 1000 people/minutes without to worry about anything,
I'm quite sure it can go up to 5000 before showing any sign of slowness.</p>

<p>All this for US$30/month</p>

<p><em>This is a follow up of my experiment with Thread Reader,
for more context <a href="/2017/09/12/thread-reader-from-idea-to-launch">read the first part here</a>
<a href="/2017/09/12/thread-reader-from-idea-to-launch">and the second part here</a></em></p>

<h1 id="solo-maker">Solo Maker</h1>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A solo maker for me is a person that is working full time on his own project and get most of its revenues from it.</em></p>

<p>So a few months ago I decided to work full time on my own.</p>

<p>To be honest, I've always had trouble getting motivated to work for some other service or product than my own projects.
And today I feel confident that I can figure it out and get enough money out of my work.</p>

<p>At that time Thread Reader was still very small and it was not the reason why I wanted to stop the usual office work.
But still it help as I had some hopes about it.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-a-typical-day-for-me%3F">So what is a typical day for me?</h2>

<p>First I wake up at 7.50am, I'm a morning person and get work done easily in the morning.
Plus as you may know I live in Vancouver, Canada 
so regarding time zones it is best for me to wake up early to answer to people, 
otherwise they could think I'm not responsive.</p>

<p>As you can deduce, I spend quite some time on user support. 
I get plenty of Direct Message on Twitter about Thread Reader:
it is mostly questions about how it works, bug reports, requests for new features... picture of dogs... 🐶</p>

<p>I try my best to listen to my users and identify pain points.<br />
I also spend some time to read my Twitter timeline to see what's up on Thread Reader, and reply if it makes sense.</p>

<p>The goal here is to make people understand that I am a real person and that I do care about their problems.</p>

<p>Then I check my TODO list for Thread Reader: I always have some bug to fix or small improvements.
Most of the time I also have a bigger feature undergoing (last one was search and took 2 weeks).</p>

<p>On the side, I have other little projects not related to Thread Reader,
mostly because I have to make some more money in case something goes wrong (in any kind of way) 
but also to keep practicing with other technologies.</p>

<p>My biggest fear is that Twitter block/prevent Thread Reader to work.
It could be because of an update of their API for example, plenty of Apps already had to stop because of this.</p>

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>

<p>This is a list of the existing feature on Thread Reader as well as tests that failed and my feelings about it.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-that-are-still-here">The one that are still here</h2>

<p><strong>Unroll/bot:</strong></p>

<p>The core of the App and works quite well now. It has some trouble to get old Thread because Twitter API does not allow it. 
Historically the bot has been blocked by twitter because they considered it too spammy. 
I had to change a few things and now it seems to be ok.</p>

<p><strong>Alerts/Subscriptions:</strong></p>

<p>Alerts allows people to subscribe to the unroll of a given author. 
This was to get people back on the website and it works very well. People love it. 
I added Twitter DM alerts for my Premium user 
(it is not possible to do it for everyone anyway because of some Twitter limitations regarding DM volume)</p>

<p><strong>Archive:</strong></p>

<p>On Thread Reader you can ask a PDF archive for a given unroll so you can save it to your computer.
It is with this feature that I introduced Premium plan for the first time. 
I personally think that these PDFs are awesome and very useful to save piece of information.</p>

<p><strong>Account page:</strong></p>

<p>When I introduced the first premium feature I had to create a private user profile so people can get their PDF.
I used that page to add other information like the list of every unroll they asked the bot, the subscriptions and more.</p>

<p><strong>Search:</strong></p>

<p>After sometime I realize that it was quite hard to have a homepage that could satisfy everyone. 
Some are more interested in politics and other in technology etc.
So I decided to add a search feature, and made it the primary way to find content on the site. 
It is quite powerful but you must be premium to access all the options.</p>

<p><strong>Read later:</strong></p>

<p>You can add any unroll to your private dashboard to find/read it later. 
I did not monitor anything about this one because I'm using it personally and I will not remove it anyway!</p>

<h2 id="the-failed-experiments">The failed experiments</h2>

<p><strong>Home page selection:</strong></p>

<p>I tried to make a homepage that could satisfy everybody but it did not make much sense.
This has been replaced by the search based homepage. The homepage still have a few selected content mostly for Google.</p>

<p><strong>Storify importer:</strong></p>

<p>Storify was closing and I thought it would be nice to allow people to migrate their content to Thread Reader.
I tried to build a Storify importer but their content was way too heterogeneous (not having only tweets).
I was too confusing, only 5 persons try to use it.</p>

<p><strong>News aggregator:</strong></p>

<p>At some point I was thinking that Thread Reader could aggregate some news websites (from their Twitter accounts) 
so you would have an overview of news. I was very happy with that feature and I personally used it every day. 
But in the end, real user did not.<br />
I removed it from the website to keep the focus on Threads. I may retry this some day!</p>

<p><strong>Public page:</strong></p>

<p>I thought that user would want to have a public page and pin a selection of their favorite threads on it.<br />
As always I try to ask people first and see the reaction.<br />
I did a <a href="https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/976234284288626689">Twitter poll</a> 
and got more than 60% of people saying that they could use it. 
To day only 5 peoples use it (including me). It will be removed in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="most-asked-feature">Most asked feature</h2>

<p>The most asked feature is to be able to unroll a thread with multiple authors (replies or comment, call it the way you want).</p>

<p>Problem is: it is not possible.<br />
Twitter does not have a way to get replies for a given Tweet! 
To be honest, even the actual basic unroll of one author is already a quite dirty trick.<br />
Also, that would mean that sometime the thread will split in two or more parts. 
Very hard to design a good interface for it.</p>

<h1 id="branding">Branding</h1>

<p>Quite early in the life of Thread Reader I could see some traction. 
And the project scope changed from an experimentation to some more serious website.</p>

<p>So the name I came with and the design I did myself in the beginning were quite wrong.</p>

<p>It was <a href="https://tttthreads.com">tttthreads.com</a> and <code>@tttthreads</code></p>

<p>For the name people were very confuse about how many <b>t</b>' you needed
and how to pronounce it to talk about it with their friends.</p>

<p>I remembered some advice from a respectable person, and he always told me: 
<i>"if you have to choose a name, make it say what the product do."</i></p>

<p><u>Thread Reader App</u> was born.</p>

<p>The design has been revisited by a real designer, 
the previous one was a little more catchy for sure but totally ugly too.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-desc" style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/writing/threadreader/evolution-thumb.jpg" />
</div>

<h1 id="money">Money</h1>

<h2 id="premium">Premium</h2>

<p>Let's talk about the important stuff: Money.</p>

<p>Thread Reader has premium membership. It was a three steps move.</p>

<ul>
<li>First I put Paypal donation on the website: I started to receive some money.</li>
<li>Second I added some premium feature (PDF Archive), you had to pay $20/year by credit card: people paid a little.</li>
<li>Third I run the number and decided to update the pricing: $30/year or $3/month (with more Premium feature too)</li>
</ul>

<p>Today my users can pay via Credit Card, Paypal or Patreon.
Surprisingly or not, Paypal is the most used provider, something like 75%!
Followed by... Patreon and only after that Credit Card.</p>

<p>I guess Credit Card payment still have a bad press on the internet.</p>

<p>As today: Monday, April the 9th I have 284 premium users.
Most of them choose the yearly payment (thus saving 2 months)</p>

<h2 id="other-source-of-income">Other source of income</h2>

<p>I have some Google Ads running on the website, these are very dependent of the traffic.<br />
It goes from $5 to $50 per day.</p>

<h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2>

<p>I subscribed to some services to help me manage all my TODO and support, it is about $30/month.<br />
The server is around $50/month and the most expensive thing is sending email alerts: it varies from $50 to $100/month.</p>

<h2 id="total">Total</h2>

<p>As today, I can live out of Thread Reader but it is not stable enough for me to be serene. 
I am thinking about other ways to get money and stabilize the whole thing.</p>

<p>That is why I'm looking for some monthly sponsorship: if you are interested <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/april-18-search-17951520">read more here</a>.</p>

<p>Thread Reader is a service working on top of Twitter so it is by definition very social.
Someday nothing much happen, but all of a sudden out of nowhere: 
800 persons/minutes goes on the website to read some buzzing content!</p>

<p>These days I'm very happy but in return I have a lot of support to do from newcomers.</p>

<h2 id="social">Social</h2>

<p>On the social side <code>@ThreadReaderApp</code> which is the bot 
but also an account that I manage by hand from time to time has 20k followers and posted 50k+ status 
(mostly automated ones for sure!)</p>

<p>Everything is increasing linearly but that does not matter I don't need an exponential growth.</p>

<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>

<p>These are some raw numbers (April 9th 2018) that does not always mean anything:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free accounts: 5100</li>
<li>Archive: 4500</li>
<li>Mention to the bot: 76K</li>
<li>Unrolled Thread: 40K</li>
<li>User with one subscription or more: 4500</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p><strong>What now?</strong></p>

<p>When I started this project a few months ago I did not think it will grow so big,
today as a solo maker I feel great, but still I have to work hard and make everything more sustainable.</p>

<p>My next step will be to find a monthly sponsorship and drop the Google Ads in return.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note: This project has been acquired in 2018, I'm no longer the owner of ThreadReaderApp</strong></p>

<p><em>For more context <a href="/2017/09/12/thread-reader-from-idea-to-launch">read the first part here</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Time to Launch!</strong></p>

<h1 id="launching">Launching</h1>

<p>I was quite naive on this one, I read through some blog post 
and I thought that you can/should show your product on a few major websites and hopefully get some interest.</p>

<p>So that is what I did, I prepared different messages to talk about my project on each platform, 
each message was quite polished and adapted to the given public and then I posted it. 
I was monitoring these posts to see if it would get some traction but… not much happened.</p>

<p>I started with <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/thread-reader">Product Hunt</a> (6 September) 
I was quite sad to get only 65 up-votes (but that would be my best score overall)
At the end of the week I did not get much traffic coming through.</p>

<p>Then I tried <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15227530">Hacker News</a> 
with little success too (haha “little” = 1 point) (12 September)</p>

<p>Even if my expectation at this time were very low, I attempted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/71rr7s/a_tool_for_twitter_unroll_threadstweetstorms_for/">Reddit on /r/SideProject</a> 
and got nothing (22 September)</p>

<p>These are the stats for that launch, be careful it is very misleading</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-desc" style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/writing/tttthreads/launch_results.png" />
</div>

<p>As I said, each of theses “communication” tries did not get me any relevant visits.<br />
The peak you can see for Product Hunt is not related to PH, Hacker News drove nothing 
and Reddit less than nothing (maybe something like 100 visits).</p>

<p>Thread Reader also got a little press coverage, but it did not help much
<a href="https://lifehacker.com/thread-reader-reformats-tweetstorms-into-text-essays-1798630765">lifehacker.com/thread-reader-reformats-tweetstorms-into-text-essays</a></p>

<p>Of course all these links that talk about the service are great as they allow a better discoverability of the tool, 
but the real peaks come from another type of traffic: influencers.</p>

<p>Let’s check that.</p>

<h1 id="get-traction">Get traction</h1>

<p>So I guess you saw that spike between Hacker News and Reddit? 
More than 10K Users that day! 🔥🔥🔥</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-desc" style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/writing/tttthreads/real_time_up.gif">
</div>

<p>On that day I went to almost 400 users live, but I was worried about the server and did not take time to get a capture. 
In the end the server was ok, everything is very well cached.</p>

<p>Thread Reader as you can imagine is deeply social, and so it is a perfect candidate for buzz of all kind.<br />
I did not look for any influencers in particular, some just decided to use the product and tweeted the given link to their audience 
(for me an influencer is someone with 10K followers or more).</p>

<p>The first peak, at the same time of Product Hunt, was a French guy with 300K followers, 
and I had a combo here as one of his friend with 200K retweeted him with the link. Big time!</p>

<p>The second major peak a few days after Hacker News was a Russian woman with “only” 11K followers, 
but she wrote a massive Tweet Story of 500+ tweets and the content was very good quality. 
People RT this like crazy and I still got many visits even today going to the site to read that story.</p>

<p>Now, from time to time, I get a random peak coming from anyplace at anytime.<br />
Last was from Spain!</p>

<p>So this is how I got some traction, influencers and good content.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-desc" style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/writing/tttthreads/stats-global.png">
</div>

<h1 id="money">Money</h1>

<h2 id="costs">Costs</h2>

<p>Let be transparent.</p>

<p>The server is in France and cost me 5 euros/month. 
That is quite cheap, but we have a good internet ecosystem there.<br />
In addition to that, I spent a month full time to develop Thread Reader and now 
I will say I take one hour every day to answer support questions and fix bugs or add small features.</p>

<p>As a freelancer in France I would ask for US$ 500 per day, 
so this project would have been about 12K including a month of support (this estimate is quite opinionated for sure).</p>

<h2 id="gains">Gains</h2>

<p><strong>Donation</strong><br />
I did not plan to make big money with that project, at the beginning I did not include any way to give me money. 
At some point I got inspired by another website and started to ask for PayPal donation. 
The very same day I received a first donation of US$10 I was so excited, 
to be honest I never imagined that people will donate.</p>

<p>Donations today sum up to US$180, people give around $8.<br />
To put that in perspective, lifetime unique users so far are about 130K so that is $0.001/user</p>

<p><strong>Crypto Mining experiment</strong><br />
At the time Thread Reader went live, a new service started, it is a crypto miner named <a href="https://coinhive.com/">CoinHive</a>. 
The idea is that a script run on my website doing some work on the computer of the user and 
I get some crypto coins in exchange (very simplified here).<br />
I was very intrigued by the concept and I thought it was worth the try.<br />
Of course, I did not implement it as most of the bad guys would do: in Thread Reader 
I warn the user with a message explaining what is going on, 
and the miner would start only if the user is on a desktop computer that is not running on battery. 
Also, I decided to use only 40% of the free computer resources of the user 
and of course they can opt out very easily straight on the website.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-desc" style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/writing/tttthreads/chmessage.png">
</div>

<p>The result is not very lucrative, I mean I don’t have that much traffic, and they don’t pay much either, 
so I gained 0.25 XMR so far worth about 22US$ (not paid yet)</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-desc" style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/writing/tttthreads/mining_report.png">
</div>

<p>I will stop that experiment soon, also it is important to note that multiple anti-virus 
consider that as Malware (it is not but it has been abused as it) so I did get few criticisms about it.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p><strong>What now?</strong></p>

<p>This project is a good excuse to build a lot of small tools to help it spread, so I made a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/thread-reader/kpdlflboeofkdonnljbeoonbglonpgdh">Google Chrome extension</a> 
that allows access to Thread Reader straight in Twitter.com, also an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citroon.threadreader">Android micro app</a> 
that leverage the share feature of the Twitter app and Android.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-desc" style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/writing/tttthreads/ext-android.png">
</div>

<p>I also experimented things, like an <a href="http://www.nopackagedeals.com/2017/10/11/1300-lies/">embed version</a>, 
it was a feature request and technically interesting to build, so I made it.<br />
But I also tested other things likes <a href="http://tttthreads.com/story/create">stories</a> 
and <a href="http://tttthreads.com/news/cps7l7j4">news stories</a> but it did not get much traction.</p>

<p>Because the feedback loop I get with these tools is very fast (it is easy to try new things) 
and thanks to the people that are very supportive and genuinely interested, 
I’m going to keep working on that service something like an hour a day for user support and bug fix.</p>

<p>I want to dedicate that blog post to my most supportive users (that would be human support not necessarily money), alphabetically:</p>
